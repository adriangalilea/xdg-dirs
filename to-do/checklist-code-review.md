# Code Review Checklist

## Project Aim and Design Decisions
The project aimed to provide a cross-platform tool for managing XDG user directories consistently across macOS and Linux, with emphasis on XDG compliance, customization, and ease of use. The key design decisions included:

3. Non-destructive updates to user directories.
4. Customizable user directory locations by editing `~/.config/user.dirs`.
5. Automatic generation of `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` file based on a merge with `~/.config/user.dirs` with XDG standards, always preferring the `~/.config/user.dirs` over standard defaults.

## Crucial Mechanism of Action - DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING BUT THE EXPORTS UNLESS `-debug`
The tool was designed to be evaluated by the shell, not to modify its own environment.
This meant every single output from the binary should be silent unless `-debug` was specified, as any single output would be `eval`'d (executed).

## General Practices for Code Review

- Respected crucial commentary, removed what was not important.
- Ensured consistent code formatting.
- Verified proper use of Go idioms and best practices.
- Verified that no output occurred unless the -debug flag was set.
- Checked for any hardcoded values that should be configurable.
- Verified cross-platform compatibility.
  - Identified any platform-specific code that might need refactoring for better compatibility.
  - Ensured that default behaviors were appropriately handled for both macOS and Linux.
- Looked for any redundant or duplicate code.

## Review Tasks

1. Reviewed cmd/xdg-user-dirs-cross/main.go:
   - [x] 1.1 Checked for proper error handling.
   - [x] 1.2 Verified command-line flag usage.
   - [x] 1.3 Reviewed the main logic flow.
   - [x] 1.4 Ensured export commands were only printed, not executed.

2. Reviewed internal/xdgdirs/xdgdirs.go:
   - [x] 2.1 Examined the XDGDirs struct and its methods.
   - [x] 2.2 Checked for potential race conditions.
   - [x] 2.3 Verified proper handling of file paths.
   - [x] 2.5 Ensured XDG compliance.

3. Reviewed internal/updater/updater.go:
   - [x] 3.1 Analyzed the Update method for completeness.
   - [x] 3.2 Checked the ensureDirectories method for edge cases.
   - [x] 3.3 Reviewed the ExportEnv method for correctness.
   - [x] 3.4 Verified error handling and logging.
   - [x] 3.5 Ensured non-destructive updates.

4. Reviewed internal/logger/logger.go:
   - [x] 4.1 Examined the logger implementation.
   - [x] 4.2 Checked for consistent log level usage.
   - [x] 4.3 Verified thread-safety of the logger.

7. Reviewed project structure:
   - [x] 7.1 Verified package organization.
   - [x] 7.2 Checked for proper separation of concerns.
   - [x] 7.3 Ensured consistent naming conventions.

8. Reviewed dependencies:
   - [x] 8.1 Checked if all dependencies were necessary.
   - [x] 8.2 Verified versions of dependencies.
   - [x] 8.3 Looked for any potential security issues with dependencies.
